This is a simple convolution neural network implemented using Tensorflow on MNIST dataset.

I have used Two layers (2 Conv layer + 2 Pool layer)

Note:

Python V3.5.3

Tensorflow V1.5
Tensorflow-Gpu V1.5

Latest NVIDIA drivers.

CUDA Toolkit 9.0
cuDNN V7.0.5 for CUDA 9.0

On CPU the code runs fine. 

Although im having trouble running on GPU.

Error:
    Allocator (GPU_0_bfc) ran out of memory trying to allocate 957.03MiB
